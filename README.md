R codes and files for reproducing the main results included in the paper *Point process modeling through a mixture of homogeneous and self-exciting processes*, by Álvaro Briz-Redón and Jorge Mateu.

- Folder *Data* contains the New Zealand earthquakes dataset analyzed in the paper.
- Folder *Functions* contains some auxiliary functions for simulating point patterns and for fitting some of the models.
- Folder *NIMBLE_codes* contains the codes in NIMBLE of the models described in the paper.
- File *1_Analysis_nz_earthquakes_data.R* allows fitting the models under comparison to the New Zealand earthquakes dataset.
- File *2_Simulation_mixture_self_exciting.R* allows simulating point patterns under the two scenarios described in the paper.
- Files *2a_Sim_study.R*, *2b_Sim_study.R*, and *2c_Sim_study.R* allow fitting the models under comparison to the simulated patterns.
